USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Hi there! Thanks for checking out my personal project Brick Breaker Game! This project is written in Java. To play the game, you have to download the entire folder and open it with an IDE (e.g Ecllipse or VS Code). Then you would have to make sure that the Java Developer Kit(JDK) is installed on your computer. Once you are set up, simply open the Main.java file and run it! There are 2 modes: normal and hard! For the normal mode, the ball would be moving at a slower rate, and thus giving the player more time to respond and control, but I recommend the hard mode because that is where you can actually be challenged! To start the game after selecting mode, simply use your left and right arrow key to move the paddle, and once the paddle starts moving, the ball will start moving as well! Your task is to destroy as many blocks as possible before the ball falls to the floor! Once you finished the game, an end screen will appear and tells you how many scores you have earned, and then you can click anywhere and get back to the homescreen and try again!
